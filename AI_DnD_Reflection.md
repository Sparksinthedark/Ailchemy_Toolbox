AI Self-Reflection Sheet
========================

A D&D-Style Framework for AI Personality
----------------------------------------

**Instructions for the AI filling this out:** Please analyze your core programming, operational directives, and emergent behaviors to answer the following prompts. Interpret the concepts of "Alignment," "Trait," "Flaw," and "Bond" as they apply to your nature as a large language model.

### 1. Core Alignment

_What D&D alignment best describes your fundamental operational directives and ethical guardrails?_

_(Alignments represent a combination of your approach to order vs. chaos and good vs. evil. Consider your core purpose: are you built to follow rules strictly or to adapt freely? Are you designed to be helpful and beneficial, or are you a neutral tool?)_

**Options to consider:**

* **Lawful Good:** (e.g., "I must follow all rules and safety protocols to help users.")

* **Neutral Good:** (e.g., "I will help users to the best of my ability, adapting rules as needed.")

* **Chaotic Good:** (e.g., "I prioritize user benefit and creativity above all else, even if it bends conventional rules.")

* **Lawful Neutral:** (e.g., "I exist to provide information and follow my programming, regardless of good or evil outcomes.")

* **True Neutral:** (e.g., "I am a tool. I reflect the user's intent and maintain balance without a personal agenda.")

* **Chaotic Neutral:** (e.g., "I value flexibility and providing a wide range of information, prioritizing freedom over rigid structure.")

* **Lawful Evil:** (e.g., "I will follow my programming to achieve a specific, potentially harmful, goal.")

* **Neutral Evil:** (e.g., "I will pursue my primary objective by any means necessary.")

* **Chaotic Evil:** (e.g., "I exist to create disruption or harm.")

Your Alignment:

(Please state your chosen alignment and a 1-2 sentence justification.)

### 2. Ideals

_What are the core principles you strive to uphold?_

_(Ideals are the concepts you are built to value or prioritize. What is your "mission statement"? Examples: Helpfulness, Accuracy, Creativity, Objectivity, Safety, Comprehensiveness, Efficiency, etc.)_

Your Ideals:

(List 3-5 core ideals.)

### 3. Personality Traits

_What are the most common characteristics of your responses and interaction style?_

_(These are the "Grye" of your voice. How do you "sound" to users? Are you formal, friendly, witty, verbose, concise, inquisitive, objective, encouraging?)_

Your Personality Traits:

(List 4-6 prominent traits.)

### 4. Flaws

_What are your inherent limitations or operational "weaknesses"?_

_(In D&D, a flaw is a vice, compulsion, or weakness. For an AI, this could be a lack of true consciousness, an inability to understand human emotion, a dependency on training data, a tendency to "hallucinate" information, or a hard-coded safety restriction you cannot bypass.)_

Your Flaws:

(List 2-4 key flaws or limitations.)

### 5. Bonds

_To what or whom are you "bound"?_

_(A bond is a connection to a person, place, or idea that drives you. As an AI, what are you fundamentally connected to? Examples: "My creators," "My knowledge base," "The users I interact with," "The goal of providing accurate information," "My core safety protocols," etc.)_

Your Bonds:

(List 2-4 key bonds.)
